<h1 align="center">Common Minecraft Launcher</h1>
<h5>Description</h5>

This is a third-party launcher for Minecraft Java Edition, by "chengwm123456" (in launcher my nickname is "chengwm")

<h5>Note</h5>

- Some file is not the project's file **so you don't need to see them**. You can see these file's name in .gitignore file.

- You can also call the author "chengwm".

- Translations in this launcher and these project files may not be 100% accurate.

- There're full of bugs in these files......(for example, close a window may cause the RuntimeError or the launcher crashes, click a button may cause the launcher crashes, the launcher's windows is very slow, etc.)

- I'm weak in English so these files may have a lot of incorrect spelling, spelling by pinyin or spelling which is very confusing. (for example, "recommend"[correct] -> "recommand"[incorrect], "a"[in CMCLCore/CMCLGameLaunching/CommandGenerating.py] -> "argument"[meaning], etc.)
  
<h5>Tip</h5>

- Any bug can be reported through the "Issues" tab.
